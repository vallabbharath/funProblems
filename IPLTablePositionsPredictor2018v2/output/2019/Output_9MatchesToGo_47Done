Probability of qualification not considering teams with equal points (in Pos 4,5, etc):
Team DD = 100
Team CSK = 100
Team MI = 80.8
Team KXP = 25.3
Team SRH = 23
Team KKR = 5.8
Team RR = 2.7


Probability of qualification, when qualifying teams with equal points (in Pos 4,5, etc) based on current NRR :
Team DD = 100
Team CSK = 100
Team MI = 98.4
Team SRH = 54.2
Team KXP = 29.6
Team KKR = 13.6
Team RR = 2.7


Probability of qualification, when qualifying teams with equal points (in Pos 4,5, etc) by splitting probability:
i.e, when 2 teams contend for pos 4, consider probability as 0.5, 3 teams for pos 4 as 0.33, 3 teams for pos 3,4 as 0.66 etc
Team DD = 100
Team CSK = 100
Team MI = 91.4
Team KXP = 38.6
Team SRH = 37.8
Team KKR = 17.4
Team RR = 12.3
Team RCB = 0.9
