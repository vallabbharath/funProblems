Qualification Scenario for team null:


Probability of qualification not considering teams with equal points (in Pos 4,5, etc):
Team AUS = 100
Team NZ = 93.1
Team IND = 85.5
Team ENG = 38.2
Team BD = 19.2
Team PAK = 18.4
Team SL = 17.5


Probability of qualification, when qualifying teams with equal points (in Pos 4,5, etc) based on current NRR :
Team AUS = 100
Team NZ = 99.6
Team IND = 92.5
Team ENG = 48.8
Team BD = 21.7
Team PAK = 18.4
Team SL = 17.5
Team WI = 1.1


Probability of qualification, when qualifying teams with equal points (in Pos 4,5, etc) by splitting probability:
i.e, when 2 teams contend for pos 4, consider probability as 0.5, 3 teams for pos 4 as 0.33, 3 teams for pos 3,4 as 0.66 etc
Team AUS = 100
Team NZ = 96.7
Team IND = 89.7
Team ENG = 43.5
Team BD = 23.8
Team SL = 22.8
Team PAK = 22.7
Team WI = 0.5
