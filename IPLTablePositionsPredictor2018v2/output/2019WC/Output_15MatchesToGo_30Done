Probability of qualification not considering teams with equal points (in Pos 4,5, etc):
Team NZ = 95.9
Team AUS = 91.7
Team IND = 87.5
Team ENG = 63.9
Team SL = 16.6
Team BD = 8.5
Team PAK = 8
Team WI = 0.2


Probability of qualification, when qualifying teams with equal points (in Pos 4,5, etc) based on current NRR :
Team NZ = 99.5
Team AUS = 96
Team IND = 92.4
Team ENG = 77.2
Team SL = 16.6
Team BD = 9.1
Team PAK = 8
Team WI = 0.8


Probability of qualification, when qualifying teams with equal points (in Pos 4,5, etc) by splitting probability:
i.e, when 2 teams contend for pos 4, consider probability as 0.5, 3 teams for pos 4 as 0.33, 3 teams for pos 3,4 as 0.66 etc
Team NZ = 97.8
Team AUS = 94.6
Team IND = 90.2
Team ENG = 70.8
Team SL = 24.4
Team BD = 10.8
Team PAK = 10.4
Team WI = 0.6
